NOTE: for NER, we have kept those, so in that part of the project we use the initial 'text' column of the table and apply only soft preprocessing. Here, we have also decided to keep some symbols that may pertain to numerical values, like currency signs (of the most popular currencies, euro, dollar, swiss franc, ruble, wuan, british pound, indian rupee), since they may typically be part of tweets expressing -negative- sentiment.\n","    - We proceed to the correction of **spelling errors**. This turned text pre-processing very computationally-expensive and time-consuming, but we took steps in the direction of maximizing the efficiency of our code and tackled that issue.\n","    - Replacing **emojis & emoticons** - encoding their word representation inside of vector representations of words was deemed as enough, no need for extra features to be extracted.\n","    - Removing **usernames & hashtags** - however, we account for their existence in a tweet (using a boolean var), making the assumption that tweets directly referring to specific people are more likely to express sentiment. We keep them both in the data used for NER (applied only on the covid-related dataset), as user mentions are typically used to directly refer to people and organizations, while hashtags were extensively used for generic pandemic references.\n","    - Removing **URLs & HTML elements** as they do not bear any contextual meaning. We perform this before removing punctuation, else we would not match them due to the lack of '://' or '.' chars.\n","    - Removing words with **length less than or equal to 2 characters** - we suppose that those mainly make for slang contractions of the type of 'ur' bearing no contextual meaning and increasing the randomness in our data.\n","    - Removing **punctuation and special characters** - we will keep the basic punctiation marks that are more likely to que at sentiment behind tweets, and drop other such characters which mainly play a syntactic role, like \":\", \";\", parentheses. We will drop '@' and '#' after we've dealt with usernames and hashtags, but we will keep symbols typically refered to in some emotional tweets (at least from our experience inspecting the datasets used in this project), like '$'. NLTK's word_tokenize() is well-suited for our usecase, since it treats such characters as separate tokens, and information on their prevalence and combination with other tokens will be integrated in the vector representations of words.\n","    - Removing **stopwords** - we opt for NLTK's 'stopwords' container for the english language, and deal only with short stopwords (up to 3 characters in length).\n","    - Removing **repetitive characters** (replace them with a double utterance to still account for their existence but in a consistent way across the dataset). We pay special attention to the retaining of '...' cases, by replacing them with '_ELIPSIS_' utterances and also accounting for their frequency in each tweet.\n","    - Remove any **escaped characters**.\n","    -
